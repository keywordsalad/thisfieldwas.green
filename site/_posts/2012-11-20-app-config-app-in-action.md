Paul Hammant found this cool [Server-Side Piano][] and I've modified it to be
configurable from a running App-Config-App. Because the sound is generated at
the server, you're able to see (hear) the Server-Side Piano change its
configuration without reloading the UI.

## Making it work for yourself

I've updated the [App-Config-App][] with additional configuration to support
choosing which instrument the Server-Side Piano will play. A clean install of
App-Config-App using `setup_examples.rb` will provide everything needed to run
the Server-Side Piano.

The application's configuration URL and credentials are located in `web.xml`.
Additional details may be found in the application's [README][].
