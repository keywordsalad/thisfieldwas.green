For prospective employers, referrals, and recruiters: <em>I optimize engineering
practices in order to maximize value.</em> The teams I work with and the
businesses I work for are best served when my skills are fully leveraged. I'm
loath to be in a position where my experience is not applicable. I am happily
employed for now but I am available for prospective chats and opportunities for
knowledge sharing.
