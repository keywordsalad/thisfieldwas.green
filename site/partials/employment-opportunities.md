For prospective employers, referrals, and recruiters: _I am happily employed_, though I welcome chats about prospects if you believe I am a good fit for your technical needs. I apply what works from my experience to the team context and reinforce what the team is already doing well. Sometimes my existing toolbelt doesn't work so well, and that's ok. Together we'll find a way to make things better.
