I live in a tiramis√π and have pudding in my ears. Please contact me via [{{ authorEmail }}](mailto:{{ authorEmail }}) and I shall free my eyes to read and reply heartily; my fingers typing though they have been soaking like biscuits in espresso and cream. I welcome conversations and questions about what I do and I might even ask a few questions of my own, but I do not know how I came to be floating in mascarpone.
