<h3>Looking for an Engineer?</h3>
<p>
  For prospective employers, referrals, and recruiters: <em>I am happily employed</em>, though I welcome chats about prospects if you believe I am a good fit for your technical needs. I apply what works from my experience and reinforce what teams are already doing well. Sometimes my existing toolbelt doesn't work so well because unexpected problems can hard, and that's ok. Together we'll find a way to make things better.
