## About

Hi, I'm Logan McGrath, and I'm a software engineer.

Most of my free time is spent in language development. Mostly for learning, but
mostly because I also dream of eventually having something out in the wild. I
write about my learnings in the hope that language development can be more
accessible to the masses. Everyone should be able to contribute to help make our
most core tools more usable and friendly.

More information about me can be found on my [LinkedIn profile][].
