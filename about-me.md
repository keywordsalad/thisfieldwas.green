Hello! I'm Logan McGrath, I'm a senior software engineer, and I specialize in a segment of software applications engineering that sits between the framework and the business logic. In my day job at [Credit Karma][] I work with a team to provide building blocks with which my fellow product engineers can more quickly deliver valuable features to members. By night I dabble in esoteric programming languages, theories, and tools to better hone my craft. It's what I like to do when my husband isn't encouraging me to go play outside.

I have been working in tech since 2007, where I started as just a wee web developer putting together shopping carts. I've since found my way into heavier engineering work.

## Tools of the Trade

I introduce my skills as a professional with the baseline requirements of modern software engineering: CI, "Agile", editor of choice (or mandate), and my employer's tech stack. My personal offering is software engineering as a craft, setting for my work a high bar for repeatability, high availability, stability, and quality so that I can reliably deliver tangible value to the stakeholders I work with and serve.

I excel as an enabler of excellence in software. I serve my teams by teaching the basics, such as automating tests and cultivating reliable builds to ensure each commit to main produces a production-ready artifact. I work with leadership to provide teams leeway to optimize their practices so that they can deliver results reliably, creating a confidence that rises through the reporting structure. This foundation of practices is requisite to modern software delivery, as technically healthy teams provide better outcomes for businesses and their customers.

This foundation is requisite independent of technology and project management. You need it for Java just as much as you need it for Haskell. Sometimes that's all a team needs, but if they (and especially leadership) have the appetite to continue improving practices and delivery, functional programming is a force multiplier that is well worth the investment.

I will be sharing retrospectives of my team experiences as no single tool or technology is more important than teaching and learning from each other. I believe being able to teach should be a cornerstone of any professional's career, as I have found no better way to highlight gaps in my own knowledge. To that end, I share here what I have learned in my life and career with hopes that others may find these experiences useful.

### Fringe Benefits

As an adjunct to a solid technical foundation, I apply functional programming techniques and I have professionally found that using even a subset of them elevates engineering as a craft. With functional programming, I can produce better outcomes with fewer bugs and greater flexibility in changing existing features and adding new ones. As this style of programming is in a certain sense still fringe, introducing it into a team's toolbox requires bringing colleagues on a journey through unknown and _seemingly dubious_ waters. The value propositions of functional programming are only apparent with experience over time, but the total investment required to become productive is no greater than that of good object oriented code, and it provides a better rate of return.

### Employment Opportunities

For prospective employers, referrals, and recruiters: _I optimize engineering practices in order to maximize value._ My relationships with any business and team thrive when my skills directly aid in realizing value, and I'm loath to be in a position where my experience is made irrelevant. I am happily employed for now but I am available for prospective chats and knowledge sharing.

## My Life Away from Work

Every few months I try looping some electronic music, but I'm really bad at it and I intend one day to share and self-deprecate.

When I'm away from the computer I'm spending time with my husband Dr. Corey Blanchette and our two dogs, Jellybean and Meatball. Corey cooks and I do the dishes if I can beat him to them. Most evenings we can be found on the patio enjoying my latest mixology attempt while he tries to teach me ways to remember different parts of human anatomy. For the most part all I can retain are the acronyms that sound inappropriate, and I'm happy to share them over a drink. One of my favorites is a mnemonic he was taught in school to name the "carpals", which I'm pretty sure is a kind of bone.

Sometimes I make bad drinks, but fortunately we have a reliable backup. We call it _The Bunny_, consisting of your choice of liquor, ginger beer, carrot juice, fresh lime, and a little bit of orange liqueur over the top. Adjust to taste and best served in a copper mug. Very refreshing, and it might even count as a serving of vegetables!

## My Life as It Relates To My Site

There is a large intersection between my personal and professional experiences. Many engineers post about their lives in their technical blogs, sometimes sharing deeply personal and difficult stories. I have the deepest of respect for their bravery and great appreciation for the empathy their writing instills. Though there are many events that have bled across my boundaries with work, I feel much trepidation sharing how I feel and describing how I process the world around me. I hope to share what is constructive, and that I can contribute to others' validation of their life experience as others have for myself.
