Hello! I'm Logan McGrath and I'm a senior software engineer specializing in applications platform engineering. In my day job at [Credit Karma][] I provide building blocks with which my fellow product engineers can more quickly deliver valuable features to members, and by night I dabble in more esoteric programming languages, theories, and tools to better hone my craft. It's what I do when my husband isn't coercing me to get some sun exposure.

I'm an avid functional programmer and advocate. My professional experience has taught me that the goals of high availability, stability, and quality are more achievable with functional programming methodologies, and that using even a subset of them elevates ones work as a craft and produces better outcomes for stakeholders. To that end, I share what practices and concepts I've found useful here in the hopes that others may benefit from them. As introducing any new ways of working requires bringing colleagues on a journey through unknown and _seemingly dubious_ waters, I will be sharing retrospectives of my team experiences as no single tool or technology is more important than teaching and learning from each other. I believe that any professional's goals should be centered around being able to teach because if you can teach a subject then you're probably grokking it too!

More information about my professional life can be found on my [LinkedIn profile][].

When I'm away from the computer I'm spending time with my husband Dr. Corey Blanchette and our two dogs, Jellybean and Meatball. Corey cooks, I do the dishes if I can beat him to them, and most evenings we can be found on the patio enjoying my latest mixology attempt while he tries to teach me ways to remember different parts of human anatomy. For the most part all I can retain are the acronyms that sound inappropriate, and I'm happy to share them over a drink. One of my favorites is a mnemonic he was taught in school to name the "carpals", which I'm pretty sure is a kind of bone. Sometimes my mixology goes awry, but fortunately we have old reliable, "The Bunny": choice of liquor, ginger beer, carrot juice, fresh lime, and a little bit of orange liqueur over the top; adjust to taste. It might even count as a serving of vegetables!
