Hello! I'm Logan McGrath, I'm a senior software engineer, and I specialize in a segment of software applications engineering that sits between the framework and the business logic. In my day job at [Credit Karma][] I work with a team to provide building blocks with which my fellow product engineers can more quickly deliver valuable features to members. By night I dabble in esoteric programming languages, theories, and tools to better hone my craft. It's what I like to do when my husband isn't encouraging me to go play outside.

I have been working in tech since 2007, where I started as just a wee web developer putting together shopping carts. I've since found my way into heavier engineering work.

### Tying It All Together

Product teams need solid building blocks to deliver features. I work as a force multiplier to provide the low code tools that businesses require for quicker implementation of features and product experiences for their customers. I  provide solutions that are stable and highly usable by product engineers, and I take great pride in high quality work that delivers value.

## My Life Away from Work

Every few months I try looping some electronic music, but I'm really bad at it and I intend one day to share and self-deprecate.

When I'm away from the computer I'm spending time with my husband Dr. Corey Blanchette and our two dogs, Jellybean and Meatball. Corey cooks and I do the dishes if I can beat him to them. Most evenings we can be found on the patio enjoying my latest mixology attempt while he tries to teach me ways to remember different parts of human anatomy. For the most part all I can retain are the acronyms that sound inappropriate, and I'm happy to share them over a drink. One of my favorites is a mnemonic he was taught in school to name the "carpals", which I'm pretty sure is a kind of bone.

Sometimes I make bad drinks, but fortunately we have a reliable backup. We call it _The Bunny_, consisting of your choice of liquor, ginger beer, carrot juice, fresh lime, and a little bit of orange liqueur over the top. Adjust to taste and best served in a copper mug. Very refreshing, and it might even count as a serving of vegetables!

## My Life as It Relates To My Site

There is a large intersection between my personal and professional experiences. Many engineers post about their lives in their technical blogs, sometimes sharing deeply personal and difficult stories. I have the deepest of respect for their bravery and great appreciation for the empathy their writing instills. Though there are many events that have bled across my boundaries with work, I feel much trepidation sharing how I feel and describing how I process the world around me. I hope to share what is constructive, and that I can contribute to others' validation of their life experience as others have for myself.
